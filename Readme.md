# React Sentiment App
This repository features a react app that when given a sentence, tells the user 
the sentiment of that sentence either happy or sad. This does not work for sentences
with a sentiment being vague or in between.

# Tensorflow
The [build-model.py](https://github.com/AustinHodge4/Sentiment-ML/blob/master/build-model.py) file 
builds the model using Tensorflow and saves it in the exports folder (created if not existing).
